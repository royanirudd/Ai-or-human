# Discord Bot (Python Version)

A Discord bot built with Python to enhance server functionality and user engagement.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.8+
- discord.py library
- asyncio for asynchronous programming
- SQLite for data storage

## Features

- Command handling system
- User role management
- Custom event listeners
- Moderation tools (kick, ban, mute)
- Fun commands (jokes, memes, trivia)
- Music playback functionality
- Scheduled tasks and reminders

## Challenges Faced

1. Implementing proper error handling for various API responses
2. Managing rate limits imposed by Discord API
3. Ensuring efficient database queries for larger servers
4. Handling concurrent commands and events
5. Implementing a robust permission system

## What I Learned

- Asynchronous programming concepts in Python
- Best practices for Discord bot development
- Efficient database design and query optimization
- Importance of proper error handling and logging
- Managing and securing API keys and tokens
- Implementing user-friendly command interfaces

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS and Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Create a `.env` file and add your Discord bot token
